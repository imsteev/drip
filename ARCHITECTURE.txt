Data concepts
* Space
  - holds a set of messages
  - id should be globally unique
* Message
  - must belong to a single space

Interactions
* Creating a space
* Creating a message
* Deleting a message

Persistence
* Implement a data layer that can easily be swapped out. Start by rapid prototyping
  with in-memory, but plan to back the app with durable storage.

API
* POST /spaces
  * return HTML that takes user to a space where they can create messages
* POST /spaces/{id}/messages
  * creates a message, and returns HTML with the new message
* DELETE /spaces/{id}
  * destroy the space, along with all the messages
* DELETE /messages/{id}
  * delete a single message
